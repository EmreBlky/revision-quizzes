## Deprication

> **Note**
> **This app is no longer maintained.**<br>
> It is recommend not to use the app, nor any of the code.

I built this while at school, I used it to revise with my mates, then extnded the app and used it as my GCSE Computing Coursewrok.
If you want to have a laugh about how ameter it was - [here's the final report](https://github.com/Lissy93/revision-quizzes/blob/master/F454%20Coursework%20-%20Revision%20Quizzes%20-%20Alicia%20Sykes%206063.pdf).

There are now much better quiz apps available, so I strongly recommend against using this project. 

Oh, and if you throught it looked narley, then you should have seen the original version! Here's some screenshots - it's absolutley horensous!!

## Deployment
It's a static PHP site. Just setup LAMP, upload the content of this repo to the www directory, then create a MySQL database, importing the [SQL backup](https://github.com/Lissy93/revision-quizzes/blob/master/reviquiz.sql), and connect it to the app by editing the credentials in the [`Db.class.php`](https://github.com/Lissy93/revision-quizzes/blob/master/php/Db.class.php) file.
